About ME Page

This my about About Me Page. 

Only HTML and CSS were used to make it. 

In it I created nav bar that when clicked will take you to the three sections of the page, which are the About Me, Work and Contact Me. I used a <nav> with <ul> and <li> <a> inside eachother. In the CSS I used position, display, margin, float, padding, among others.

In the About Me section, for the HTML I used <h1> and <p>, for the CSS I used display, justify content, border-right, among others.

In the Work section, for the HTML I used <h1> and <div> and <img> for the CSS I used display, flex-wrap, flex-direction, position, border-right, among others. I also used images that I will update later and turn them into projects.

In the Contact Me section, for the HTML I used <h1> and <p>, <li>, <a>, <ul> for the CSS I used display, justify content, border-right, among others.
